# FragmentShaderViewer

A simple program to view fragment shaders after editing them since i couldn't find a working shader editor for windows 7

Written in C++ with SFML

Depends on SFML

Used https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads for windows version of the std::thread implementation
Thanks Microsoft
